      <h2>1st Monthsary Message</h2>
      <p>When I first received your letter I was happy because I knew I would make a new friend. I replied to your letter the moment it reached me. Then you replied again and I was happy because I was expecting you not to reply but you did. From then on I wrote to you often and I thought of you all day. That was when I knew that I liked you. 
Then the day came on October 22 2025. I gathered my courage and told you what I felt. I asked you out with the confidence that you gave me. I expected you to turn me down and say it was only a youthful crush. But you accepted me. You accepted my feelings for you. In that moment I felt over the moon. I felt complete like you were the missing puzzle piece in my life. 
I did not like you only for your outside. I loved the side of you that showed strength in your vulnerability. I felt touched when you trusted me. It inspired me to trust you too. I trust you Russ. Your kindness and your thoughts and your strength and the you that you showed me. I fell in love with all of it. 
I wrote to you even late at night because I did not want to waste any second of not replying. I wanted to talk to you and see your response fast. My days became brighter and happier and more dreamy whenever you replied to me. My heart raced so fast that I could hear it in my ear. My smile would not go away. And my love for you grew into a love filled with respect and faithfulness and devotion. You showed me what it means to love someone with patience, understanding, and depth. I am thankful for everything baby ko. You are the one man I will never forget. You mean the world to me. 
Happy 1st Monthsary baby ko. In this new milestone I promise that I will care for you, cherish you, and give you all my love. I want to give you a forever love and kisses. Mwaaaaahhhhh. I hope we reach more milestones together. You are my precious baby love, now and always.</p>
